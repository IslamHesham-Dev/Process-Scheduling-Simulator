# Process-Scheduling-Simulator
This project involves the development of a process scheduling and execution simulation system. Key components include a ready queue, memory for variable storage, and Process Control Blocks (PCBs) containing Process ID, Program Counter, and Memory Boundaries. The system supports two scheduling algorithms: Round Robin and Shortest Job First.
